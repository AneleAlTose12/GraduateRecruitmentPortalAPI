## Repository Interfaces & Classes Naming Convention
### Packaging the Interfaces and Implementation Classes
All files should be kept in a single package. The interface and its implementation.
```
e.g Inside the Service Package, a IStudentService.java and StudentServiceImpl.java should be located in the Service package.
DO NOT CREATE AN IMPL Package specifically for the implementation class of the interface.
```
### Naming the Interface
All interfaces created should follow the convention below.
An interface name should be preceded by an ```I``` then followed
by its ```Name``` then ```Repository```. 
```
e.g IStudentRepository.java
```
This is an interface for Student. 
The respective implementation
class for the interface above should be named.
```
e.g StudentRepositoryImpl.java
```
#### You are strictly advised to stick to the naming convention while working on the project, failure to do so will result in the code will being rejected upon reviewing.
